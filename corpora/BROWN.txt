The last obstacle in Mrs. Geraghty 's globe-girdling trip was smoothed out when a representative of Syria called upon her to explain that his brother would meet her at the border of that country Ч so newly separated from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she had n't been able to obtain a visa .

Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army 's Social Center at 1200 Larimer st . 
The pert , gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo , N.Y. , is a " civilian " with the Army . 
Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director . The job also covers a number of other items . 
" Mom " Marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society . 
Her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs. Marr 's office is always open and the welcome mat is out . 
MRS . MARR is contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up .
She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures . 
" Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men " , Mrs. Marr explained . 
The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center . 
" And I bum tickets to everything I can " , she said . " I 've become the greatest beggar in the world " . 
IN ADDITION to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system . 
Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to " mother " , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society . 
By mid-June , millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land . 
In another four weeks , with schools closed across the nation , the great all-American summer safari will be under way . By July 1 , six weeks from now , motel-keepers all over the nation will , by 6 p.m. , be switching on that bleak Ч to motorists Ч sign , " No Vacancy " . 
No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer , probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car , throw suitcases , kids and comic books in the back seat , and head for home . And where is " home " , that magic place of the heart ? 
Ah , that is simple . Home is where a man was born , reared , went to school and , most particularly , where grandma is . That is where we turn in the good old summertime . 
The land lies ready for the coming onslaught . My husband and I , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson , Ariz. , to New York City :  SET FOR INFLUX  I can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting . 
I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations . 
Maybe motel-keeping is n't the nation 's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway . 
There are motels for all purposes and all tastes . There are even motels for local weather peculiarities , as I discovered in Shamrock , Tex . There the Royal Motel advertises " all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free TV , storm cellar " .  MANY WITH POOLS  Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( " swim at your own risk " is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . Some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children . But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar . 
Motorists like myself who can remember the old " tourists accommodated " signs on farm houses and village homes before World War /2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business .  ALL FOR $14 !  At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester , Va. , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels . All for $14 . 
That made up for the " best " motel in Norman , Okla. , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture . 
Oxnard , Calif. , will be the home of the Rev. Robert D. Howard and his bride , the former Miss Judith Ellen Gay , who were married Saturday at the Munger Place Methodist Church .

The Rev. Richard Freeman of Texas City officiated and Charles Pabor and Mrs. Marvin Hand presented music . The bride was given in marriage by her father .

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12.01 A.M. next Saturday . The current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000 . 
Howard E. Simpson , the railroad 's president , said , " A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action " . 
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. + O. operates .  SALARY CUT AND LAY-OFFS  It will be accomplished in two ways :  1 .  
A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class .  2 .  
Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . 
Since the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B.+O. spokesman said . 
Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . 
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed can not be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job . 
A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount streets . 
The victim , Norman B. Wiley , 38 , of the 900 block North Charles street , was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery . 
The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money . The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit . 
He said the assailant , who was armed with a .45-caliber automatic , entered the taxi at Pennsylvania avenue and Gold street . 
In another attack , Samuel Verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken street , told police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him . 
A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel county home . 
The victim Darnell Somerville , Negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in Annapolis . 
His sister and brother , Marie Louise , 3 , and John Raymond , Jr . 22 months , were admitted to the hospital . The girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body .  BOY IN FAIR CONDITION  The boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back . His condition was reported to be fair . 
Police said the children 's mother , Mrs. Eleanor Somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred . 
The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park , at Jones Station , police said .  ANNAPOLIS , JAN. 7  
- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what . 
The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams , Jr. , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week 's meeting . 
The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting .  CITES DISCREPANCIES  Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins 's conversation and how they were written up for the board 's approval . 
" I hate to have these things come up again and again " , Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion . " These are the board 's minutes . I 'll write what you tell me to " . 
For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago . 
It was about that time , a board member said later , that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen , Jr. , State superintendent of schools , told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him . 
The Board of County Commissioners , the Sanitary Commission , the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings . 
Dr. Jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the State do not do so . 
State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli ( D. , First Baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt street . 
He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal ambulance . 
Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side . His condition was said to be , " fair " . 
Police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt street .  BARBER SUMMONED  He called Vincent L. Piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance . 
The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are " deficiencies " in the city 's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible . 
Councilman William D. Schaefer ( D. , Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month .  WERNER CRITICIZED  Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm , Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here . 
He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December . Equipment should be in operation " almost immediately after the first snowfall " , Mr. Schaefer said . 
The Councilman , who is the Administration floor leader , also criticized Bernard L. Werner , public works director , for " halting snow operations " on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm .  SENT HOME FOR REST  Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week . What he did , Mr. Werner said , was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest . Work resumed Wednesday , he said . 
Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be " strictly enforced " . 
Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas " not be overlooked Е if our small merchants are to survive " . 
Recounting personal observations of clearance work , the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes .  ANNAPOLIS , JAN. 7 ( SPECIAL )  
- The 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay-front home , has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detention . 
The victims were H. Malone Dresbach , 47 , and his wife , Shirley , 46 . Each had been shot in the back several times with a .22-caliber automatic rifle , according to Capt. Elmer Hagner , chief of Anne Arundel detectives . 
Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail . The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court . 
 YOUNGER SON CALLS POLICE  Soon after 10 A.M. , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the Franklin Manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the Dresbach 's other son , Lee , 14 , they found Mrs. Dresbach 's body on the first-floor bedroom floor . Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said . 
The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother 's car . 
The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio .  TWO BROTHERS ADOPTED  Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs . 
Trooper J. A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a Route 2 service station , just outside Annapolis . The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs ' son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station , police said .  ANNAPOLIS , JAN. 7  
- Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L. Simpkins , his administrative assistant , as Maryland 's Secretary of State . 
Mr. Simpkins will move into the post being vacated by Thomas B. Finan , earlier named attorney general to succeed C. Ferdinand Sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of Appeals . 
Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next Friday .  SIMPKINS FROM SOMERSET  Mr. Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county , and he and the Governor , also a Somerset countian , have been friends since Mr. Simpkins was a child . 
Now 38 , Mr. Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland 's College of Agriculture in 1947 . 
Five years later , he was awarded the university degree in law .
Mr. Simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958 . From the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates . 
MARYLAND contracts for future construction during October totaled $77,389,000 , up to 10 per cent compared to October , 1960 , F. W. Dodge , Dodge Corporation , reported . 
Dodge reported the following breakdown : 
Nonresidential at $20,447,000 , down 28 per cent ; residential at $47,101,000 , up 100 per cent ; and heavy engineering at $9,841,000 , down 45 per cent . 
The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000 , a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year . 
A breakdown of the ten-month total showed : 
Nonresidential at $253,355,000 , up 22 per cent ; residential at $278,877,000 , up 12 per cent ; and heavy engineering at $102,285,000 , down 33 per cent . 
Residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter . 
The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time . 
In 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction . 
While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field . 
Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , Leo J. Pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house .  CONVENIENCE HELD KEY  " Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today . Trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 " , Pantas predicted . 
SIXTY-SEVEN living units are being added to the 165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section . 
Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures . Various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct . Others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies . 
The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction . Heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems . 
CONSTRUCTION in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by Johns-Manville Corporation .   LONDON , FEB. 9  
- Vital secrets of Britain 's first atomic submarine Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy 's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today .
The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . It is a killer sub Ч that is , a hunter of enemy subs . It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy 's Nautilus , the world 's first atomic submarine . Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack .  FIVE HELD FOR TRIAL  The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow st. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . A full trial was ordered for : 
Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . 
Gordon A. Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian altho he carries a Canadian passport . When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping , it was testified .  FLASHED TO MOSCOW  A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce . 
[ In Washington , the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen , an American couple formerly of New York City . ] 
In their suburban cottage the crown charges , the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first Saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books . Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript . 
All five pleaded innocent . Only Miss Gee asked for bail . Her young British lawyer , James Dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop .  REFUSES TO GRANT BAIL  " I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them " , said the magistrate , K.J.P. Baraclough . 
The trial will be held , probably the first week of March , in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs , the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison . 
Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s . Fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior . He promptly went to communist East Germany . 
The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency , mostly $20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks . 
" This is Russian money " , said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general 's office . He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country 's secrets .  " OF HIGHEST VALUE "  The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought , and thereby of the American undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier . 
But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy 's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt. George Symonds . He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7 . 
The information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy .  COURT CLEARED  Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold . 
The British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve . So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour . 
Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet . Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed . The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack . 
With the machinery went a complete design for the hull . 
The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it .  NAVY 'S FUTURE INVOLVED  " Much of the navy 's future depends upon her " , an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack 's first arrival in British waters in August , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station . It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work . 
" Her basic hull form [ a teardrop ] and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines " , the statement went on . 
The atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp . Thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said . 
The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work . It was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954 . 
The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built . Reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers . It could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month . 
It was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advance gear and destroy them with torpedoes . 
The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee 's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture " of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future " .  INTERESTED IN DETECTOR  The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified . Range was a vital detail . Designs of parts were sought . 
Six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale 's apartment and the Krogers ' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid . Oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested . 
The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives " is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity " on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court . 
The three Ч Miles J. Cooperman , Sheldon Teller , and Richard Austin Ч and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws . 
In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard H. Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were " entirely innocent " .  'HAD TO KNOW PEDDLERS '  " When they became members of the city police narcotics unit " , Sokol said , " they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket . They , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers " . 
Altho federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were " aiming at the same criminals " . This , he added , brought about " petty jealousies " and " petty personal grievances " . 
" In the same five year period that the United States says they [ the detectives ] were engaged in this conspiracy " , Sokol continued , " these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor 's medal " .  NO COMMENTS BY U.S.  In opening , D. Arthur Connelly , assistant United States attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments . Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients ' guilt . 
Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , Otis Sears , 45 , of 6934 Indiana av . Among other acts , Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears . 
 witness , Moses Winston Mardis , 5835 Michigan av. , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made . But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted .
Buaford Robinson , 23 , of 7026 Stewart av. , a CTA bus driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st street and South Park way . Robinson was treated at a physician 's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee . His losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck . 
Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High school , 30th street and South Park way , and began " skylarking " . 
When 51st street was reached , Robinson related , he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the CTA supervisor . As he left the bus with his money bag , Robinson added , the largest youth accosted him , a quarrel ensued , and the youth knocked him down . Then the youths fled with his money . 
Mrs. Blanche Dunkel , 60 , who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law , Ervin Lang , then 28 , appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members , John M. Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier . She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison , but former Gov . Stratton commuted her term to 75 years , making her eligible for parole , as one of his last acts in office . 
Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934 . It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place . 
The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20 . 
The defendant , William L. Stickney /3 , 23 , of 3211 Park pl. , Evanston , who pleaded guilty to reckless driving , also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month . 
Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing , Inc. , 2544 Green Bay rd. , Evanston , a food brokerage and grocery chain firm , of which his father , William L. Jr. , is president . 
Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart avenue at Central street . 
At Jenks street , Simms said , the car skidded completely around , just missed two parked cars , and sped east in Jenks . 
The car spun around again , Simms said , before Stickney could turn north in Prairie avenue , and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie .   ST . JOHNS , MICH. , APRIL 19 .  
- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . 
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard .  STEPSON VINDICATED  The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman 's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . 
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . When the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said : 
" I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . Still , I do n't wish to appear happy at somebody 's else 's misfortune " .  LIVES ON WELFARE  Hengesbach , who has been living on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here . 
Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 . 
Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police . 
He also admitted killing Mrs. Hengesbach . However , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial .  CHARGES IN DOUBT  Assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis , who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases , said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl . 
Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for sentencing . Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation . 
Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure .  LOCKED IN MOTEL  A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation . The jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced . 
The jury foreman , Mrs. Olive Heideman , of rural Elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence .
She said the jurors agreed that Pohl 's confession was valid . 
The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter . 
The verdict came three hours later . 
Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read . The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week . 
A Sterling Township family of six surviving children , whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children , found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends . 
While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother 's duties , fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski family , 34220 Viceroy . 
Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski , 42 , died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother , Mrs. Mary Pankowski , in the adjoining suburb of Warren .  SERVICES TOMORROW  Funeral services for Mrs. Kowalski and her daughter , Christine , 11 , who died of burns at the same hospital Monday , have been scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow in St. Anne 's Catholic Church , 31978 Mound , in Warren . 
The mother and daughter , who will be buried side by side in Mt . Olivet Cemetery , rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home , 31730 Mound , Warren . 
Mrs. Pankowski , 61 , remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while Mrs. Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother 's small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile road east .  HELD CANDLE  Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity . 
Christine 's twin sister , Patricia , and Darlene Kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns . They are home now with the other Kowalski children , Vicky , 14 ; Dennis , 6 ; Eleanor , 2 ; and Bernardine , 1 . 
" All we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay together the way Mother wanted " , Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother 's death yesterday afternoon . 
Kowalski , a roofer who seldom worked last winter , already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills .  $135 DONATED  Neighbor women , such as Mrs. Sidney Baker , 2269 Serra , Sterling Township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with Kowalski 's sister-in-law , Mrs. Anna Kowalski , 22111 David , East Detroit . 
Another neighbor , Mrs. Frank C. Smith , 2731 Pall Mall , Sterling Township , surprised Kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs . 
John C. Houghton , president of the Tareytown Acres Homeowners Association , followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family .  STUDENTS HELP OUT  Houghton said 6 p.m . Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision , which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile road east . He said contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box 553 , Warren Village Station . 
Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior High School , 5155 Fourteen Mile road east . 
Principal Clayton W. Pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today , and revealed that Y-Teen Club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs. Kowalski .  FUNDS FROM DANCES  Student Council officers announced today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago , and another dance for Fuhrmann 's 770 students this Friday night . 
" Furhmann 's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family , Pohly said . 
There also were reports of a collection at the County Line Elementary School , 3505o Dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine .  EXPRESSES THANKS  Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last Saturday . But today he wanted to make a public statement . 
" I never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family . I was n't sure there were such people anywhere in the world . I 'll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them " . 
An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist . 
Patrolman George Kimmell , of McClellan Station , said he would recommend a special safety citation for Ralph Sisk , 9230 Vernor east , a third grader at the Scripps School , for his assistance in the case . 
Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk .  GETS CAR NUMBER  Kimmell ordered the driver to back up , watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly " took off at high speed " , he said , narrowly missing him . 
Commandeering a passing car , Kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle , but lost it in traffic . Returning to the school crossing , the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver , a neighbor , and had obtained the license number . 
The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees , 17 , of 2433 McClellan , currently on probation and under court order not to drive .  GIVEN 15 DAYS  He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by Traffic Judge George T. Murphy , who continued his no-driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit House of Correction . The jail sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June . 
The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today . 
Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire .  HELP ASKED  In Vientiane , the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its " friends and neighbors " for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast Asian kingdom . 
Britain 's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home . 
He said Britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened , sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire . 
A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5 , he said .  PLEA FOR ARMS  The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana . He indicated that requests would be made for more U.S. arms and more U.S. military advisers . 
He declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens . 
One of moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body .
A note making the request was handed to U.S. Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown .  HEAVY SUPPORT  The Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam . 
The minister , describing the attacks which led up to the appeal , said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front Ч near Thakhek , in southern-central Laos . 
There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources . In the past such government claims have been found exaggerated .  HAVANA , APRIL 19 .  
- Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators . 
A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair . 
The executions took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar del Rio , where the executions took place .  ARMS PLOT CHARGED  The broadcast said Anderson , a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman , and McNair , of Miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels .

Emory University Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state 's tax laws made such a step possible .
" Emory University charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race " , board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated .
But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . 
The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . 
" Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions " , the statement said . 
The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . 
An Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . 
The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , " all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people " . 
At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state . 
Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church . Some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation .  URGED IN 1954  The student newspaper , The Emory Wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation . 
" From its beginning " , the trustees ' statement said Friday , " Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning . Teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under Christian influence , are paramount in the Emory University policy . 
" As a private institution , supported by generous individuals , Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education . 
" There is not now , nor has there ever been in Emory University charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed . Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed .  CORPORATE EXISTENCE  " On the other hand , Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia . Е
" When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education " .
